\section{Introduction}
　　　Automatic driving technology is more and more developing.  Automatic driving is divided into level  5 depending on technology installed.  In Japan, general car install level 2 supporting driver.  In the future,  Japan government set a goal that the vehicle installed level 4 become popular.  If a lot of automatic driving cars are used in a city, some problems may be occurred.  Thus, we need autonomous-vehicle group control algorithms.  In this paper, I verify the autonomous-vehicle group control algorithms with formal method.
